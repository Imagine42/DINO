# DINO-DETR: Deformable DETR with Improvements

## Overview
This project provides a robust object detection system based on **DINO-DETR**, an enhanced version of Deformable DETR.  
It supports text and object detection, bounding box visualization, and is optimized for GPU environments.

---

## Features
- **Input Formats**: Supports images (JPEG, PNG).
- **Text Detection**: Leverages DINO-DETR for accurate text detection with normalized bounding boxes and confidence scores.
- **Visualization**: Bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores are rendered on the input image.
